# model_2


Model 2 utilizes a combination of forecasting data and observation data to predict the likelihood of an avalanche event on a given date. It leverages the peak or elevation information from the forecasting data and combines it with the avalanche risk assessments derived from current observation data. By integrating these two sources of information, Model 2 aims to provide a more accurate prediction of avalanche events, enabling better preparedness and safety measures for individuals and communities in avalanche-prone areas.
